#Save Measurements Data as an object
```{r}
MData = read.csv("measurements.csv")
```

#Load Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

#Add a new column called Sp that shortens the genus name in the Organism column to only the first letter and period. 

```{r}
#Use dplyr to select the organism column and mutate it into a new column
MData = MData %>%
  #Use Regex to change the format of the Organism name
  mutate(Sp = gsub("(\\w)\\w+\\s","\\1. ",Organism))
```

# Use a dplyr command to create a new dataset BUT with Sp column instead of the Organism column, moved to the beginning in place of the original Organism column.
```{r}
NewDat = MData %>%
  select(Sp, Limb.width, Limb.length, Observer)
```

# Save the dataset as a new file called MeasShort.csv
```{r}
write.csv(NewDat,"MeasShort.csv") 
```
